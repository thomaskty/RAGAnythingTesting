Tables are parsed into structured cells with headers and values. Mathematical expressions are converted into symbolic representations. The resulting $x _ { j }$ preserves both content and structural context within the source. This provides a faithful, modalityconsistent representation. The decomposition abstracts diverse file formats into atomic units while maintaining their hierarchical order and contextual relationships. This canonicalization enables uniform processing, indexing, and retrieval of multimodal content within our framework. \n\n2.2.1 DUAL-GRAPH CONSTRUCTION FOR MULTIMODAL KNOWLEDGE \n\nWhile multimodal knowledge unification provides a uniform abstraction across modalities, directly constructing a single unified graph often risks overlooking modality-specific structural signals. The proposed RAG-Anything addresses this challenge through a dual-graph construction strategy. The system first builds a cross-modal knowledge graph that faithfully grounds non-textual modalities within their contextual environment. It then constructs a text-based knowledge graph using established text-centric extraction pipelines. These complementary graphs are merged through entity alignment. This design ensures accurate cross-modal grounding and comprehensive coverage of textual semantics, enabling richer knowledge representation and robust retrieval. \n\n• Cross-Modal Knowledge Graph: Non-textual content like images, tables, and equations contains rich semantic information that traditional text-only approaches often overlook. To preserve this knowledge, RAG-Anything constructs a multimodal knowledge graph where non-text atomic units are transformed into structured graph entities. RAG-Anything leverages multimodal large language models to derive two complementary textual representations from each atomic content unit. The first is a detailed description $d _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { c h u n k } }$ optimized for cross-modal retrieval. The second is an entity summar y eentity c ontaining key attributes such as entity name, type, and description for graph construction. The generation process is context-aware, processing each unit with its local neighborhood $C _ { j } = \\{ c _ { k } \\ | \\ | k - j | \\leq \\delta \\}$ , where $\\delta$ controls the contextual window size. This ensures representations accurately reflect each unit’s role within the broader document structure. \n\nBuilding on these textual representations, RAG-Anything constructs the graph structure using nontext units as anchor points. For each non-text unit $c _ { j }$ , the graph extraction routine $R ( \\cdot )$ processes its description $d _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { c h u n k } }$ to identify fine-grained entities and relations: \n\nwhere $\\nu _ { j }$ and $\\mathcal { E } _ { j }$ denote the sets of intra-chunk entities and their relations, respectively. Each atomic non-text unit is associated with a multimodal entity node $v _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { m m } }$ that serves as an anchor for \n\nits intra-chunk entities through explicit belongs_to edges: \n\nThis construction preserves modality-specific grounding while ensuring non-textual content is contextualized by its textual neighborhood. This enables reliable cross-modal retrieval and reasoning. \n\n• Text-based Knowledge Graph: For text modality chunks, we construct a traditional text-based knowledge graph following established methodologies similar to LightRAG (Guo et al., 2024) and GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024). The extraction process operates directly on textual content $x _ { j }$ where $t _ { j } =$ text, leveraging named entity recognition and relation extraction techniques to identify entities and their semantic relationships. Given the rich semantic information inherent in textual content, multimodal context integration is not required for this component. The resulting text-based knowledge graph captures explicit knowledge and semantic connections present in textual portions of documents, complementing the multimodal graph’s cross-modal grounding capabilities. \n\n2.2.2 GRAPH FUSION AND INDEX CREATION \n\nThe separate cross-modal and text-based knowledge graphs capture complementary aspects of document semantics. Integrating them creates a unified representation leveraging visual-textual associations and fine-grained textual relationships for enhanced retrieval. \n\n• (i) Entity Alignment and Graph Fusion. To create a unified knowledge representation, we merge the multimodal knowledge graph $( \\tilde { V } , \\tilde { E } )$ and text-based knowledge graph through entity alignment. This process uses entity names as primary matching keys to identify semantically equivalent entities across both graph structures. The integration consolidates their representations, creating a comprehensive knowledge graph $\\mathcal { G } = ( \\nu , \\mathcal { E } )$ . This graph captures both multimodal contextual relationships and text-based semantic connections. The merged graph provides a holistic view of the document collection. This enables effective retrieval by leveraging visual-textual associations from the multimodal graph and fine-grained textual knowledge relationships from the text-based graph. \n\n• (ii) Dense Representation Generation. To enable efficient similarity-based retrieval, we construct a comprehensive embedding table $\\tau$ that encompasses all components generated during the indexing process. We encode dense representations for all graph entities, relationships, and atomic content chunks across modalities using an appropriate encoder. This creates a unified embedding space where each component $s \\in$ entities, relations, chunks is mapped to its corresponding dense representation: \n\nwhere $\\mathrm { e m b } ( \\cdot )$ denotes the embedding function tailored for each component type. Together, the unified knowledge graph $\\mathcal { G }$ and the embedding table $\\tau$ constitute the complete retrieval index ${ \\mathcal { T } } = ( { \\mathcal { G } } , { \\mathcal { T } } )$ . This provides both structural knowledge representation and dense vector space for efficient cross-modal similarity search during the subsequent retrieval stage. \n\n2.3 CROSS-MODAL HYBRID RETRIEVAL \n\nThe retrieval stage operates on the index $\\mathcal { I } = ( \\\n```",

Our approach employs a dual-graph construction strategy that elegantly bridges the gap between cross-modal understanding and fine-grained textual semantics. Rather than forcing diverse modalities into textcentric pipelines, RAG-Anything constructs complementary knowledge graphs that preserve both multimodal contextual relationships and detailed textual knowledge. This design enables seamless integration of visual elements, structured data, and mathematical expressions within a unified retrieval framework. The system maintains semantic integrity across modalities while ensuring efficient cross-modal reasoning capabilities throughout the process. \n\nOur cross-modal hybrid retrieval mechanism strategically combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic similarity matching. This architecture addresses the fundamental limitation of existing approaches that rely solely on embedding-based retrieval or keyword matching. RAG-Anything leverages explicit graph relationships to capture multi-hop reasoning patterns. It simultaneously employs dense vector representations to identify semantically relevant content that lacks direct structural connections. The framework introduces modality-aware query processing and cross-modal alignment systems. These enable textual queries to effectively access visual and structured information. This unified approach eliminates the architectural fragmentation that plagues current multimodal RAG systems. It delivers superior performance particularly on long-context documents where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities and document sections. \n\nExperimental Validation. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging multimodal benchmarks: DocBench and MMLongBench. Our evaluation demonstrates that RAG-Anything achieves superior performance across diverse domains. The framework represents substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, our performance gains become increasingly significant as content length increases. We observe particularly pronounced advantages on long-context materials. This validates our core hypothesis that dual-graph construction and cross-modal hybrid retrieval are essential for handling complex multimodal materials. Our ablation studies reveal that graph-based knowledge representation provides the primary performance gains. Traditional chunk-based approaches fail to capture the structural relationships critical for multimodal reasoning. Case studies further demonstrate that our framework excels at precise localization within complex layouts. The system effectively disambiguates similar terminology and navigates multi-panel visualizations through structure-aware retrieval mechanisms. \n\n2 THE RAG-ANYTHING FRAMEWORK \n\n2.1 PRELIMINARY \n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for dynamically expanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs. While LLMs demonstrate exceptional reasoning capabilities, their knowledge remains static and bounded by training data cutoffs. This creates an ever-widening gap with the rapidly evolving information landscape. RAG systems address this critical limitation by enabling LLMs to retrieve and incorporate external knowledge sources during inference. This transforms them from static repositories into adaptive, knowledge-aware systems. \n\nThe Multimodal Reality: Beyond Text-Only RAG. Current RAG systems face a critical limitation that severely restricts their real-world deployment. Existing frameworks operate under the restrictive assumption that knowledge corpus consists exclusively of plain textual documents. This assumption fundamentally misaligns with how information exists in authentic environments. Real-world knowledge repositories are inherently heterogeneous and multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured data, and mathematical expressions. These diverse knowledge sources span multiple document formats and presentation mediums, from research papers and technical slides to web pages and interactive documents. \n\n2.1.1 MOTIVATING RAG-ANYTHING \n\nThis multimodal reality introduces fundamental technical challenges that expose the inadequacy of current text-only RAG approaches. Effective multimodal RAG requires unified indexing strategies that can handle disparate data types, cross-modal retrieval mechanisms that preserve semantic relationships across modalities, and sophisticated synthesis techniques that can coherently integrate diverse information sources. These challenges demand a fundamentally different architectural approach rather than incremental improvements to existing systems. \n\nThe RAG-Anything framework introduces a unified approach for retrieving and processing knowledge from heterogeneous multimodal information sources. Our system addresses the fundamental challenge of handling diverse data modalities and document formats within a retrieval pipeline. The framework comprises three core components: universal indexing for multimodal knowledge, cross-modal adaptive retrieval, and knowledge-enhanced response generation. This integrated design enables effective knowledge utilization across modalities while maintaining computational efficiency. \n\n2.2 UNIVERSAL REPRESENTATION FOR HETEROGENEOUS KNOWLEDGE \n\nA key requirement for universal knowledge access is the ability to represent heterogeneous multimodal content in a unified, retrieval-oriented abstraction. Unlike existing pipelines that simply parse documents into text segments, RAG-Anything introduces Multimodal Knowledge Unification. This process decomposes raw inputs into atomic knowledge units while preserving their structural context and semantic alignment. For instance, RAG-Anything ensures that figures remain grounded in their captions, equations remain linked to surrounding definitions, and tables stay connected to explanatory narratives. This transforms heterogeneous files into a coherent substrate for cross-modal retrieval. \n\nFormally, each knowledge source $k _ { i } \\in \\mathcal { K }$ (e.g., a web page) is decomposed into atomic content units: \n\nwhere each unit $c _ { j }$ consists of a modality type $t _ { j } \\in$ text, image, table, equation, . . . and its corresponding raw content $x _ { j }$ . The content $x _ { j }$ represents the extracted information from the original knowledge source, processed in a modality-aware manner to preserve semantic integrity. \n\nTo ensure high-fidelity extraction, RAG-Anything leverages specialized parsers for different content types. Text is segmented into coherent paragraphs or list items. Figures are extracted with associated metadata such as captions and cross-references. Tables are parsed into structured cells with headers and values. Mathematical expressions are converted into symbolic representations. The resulting $x _ { j }$ preserves both content and structural context within the source. This provides a faithful, modalityconsistent representation. The decomposition abstracts diverse file formats into atomic units while maintaining their hierarchical order and contextual relationships. This canonicalization enables uniform processing, indexing, and retrieval of multimodal content within our framework. \n\n2.\n```",

This provides both structural knowledge representation and dense vector space for efficient cross-modal similarity search during the subsequent retrieval stage. \n\n2.3 CROSS-MODAL HYBRID RETRIEVAL \n\nThe retrieval stage operates on the index $\\mathcal { I } = ( \\mathcal { G } , \\mathcal { T } )$ to identify relevant knowledge components for a given user query. Traditional RAG methods face significant limitations when dealing with multimodal documents. They typically rely on semantic similarity within single modalities and fail to capture the rich interconnections between visual, mathematical, tabular, and textual elements. To address these challenges, our framework introduces a cross-modal hybrid retrieval mechanism. This mechanism leverages structural knowledge and semantic representations across heterogeneous modalities. \n\nModality-Aware Query Encoding. Given a user query $q$ , we first perform modality-aware query analysis to extract lexical cues and potential modality preferences embedded within the query. For instance, queries containing terms such as \"figure,\" \"chart,\" \"table,\" or \"equation\" provide explicit signals about the expected modality of relevant information. We then compute a unified text embedding ${ \\mathbf { e } _ { q } }$ using the same encoder employed during indexing, ensuring consistency between query and knowledge representations. This embedding-based approach enables cross-modal retrieval capabilities where textual queries can effectively access multimodal content through their shared representations, maintaining retrieval consistency while preserving cross-modal accessibility. \n\nHybrid Knowledge Retrieval Architecture. Recognizing that knowledge relevance manifests through both explicit structural connections and implicit semantic relationships, we design a hybrid retrieval architecture that strategically combines two complementary mechanisms. \n\n• (i) Structural Knowledge Navigation. This mechanism addresses the challenge of capturing explicit relationships and multi-hop reasoning patterns. Traditional keyword-based retrieval often fails to identify knowledge connected through intermediate entities or cross-modal relationships. To overcome this limitation, we exploit the structural properties encoded within our unified knowledge graph G. We employ keyword matching and entity recognition to locate relevant graph components. The retrieval process begins with exact entity matching against query terms. \n\nWe then perform strategic neighborhood expansion to include related entities and relationships within a specified hop distance. This structural approach proves particularly effective at uncovering highlevel semantic connections and entity-relation patterns that span multiple modalities. It capitalizes on the rich cross-modal linkages established in our multimodal knowledge graph. The structural navigation yields candidate set $\\mathcal { C } _ { \\mathrm { s t r u } } ( { q } )$ containing relevant entities, relationships, and their associated content chunks that provide comprehensive contextual information. \n\n• (ii) Semantic Similarity Matching. This mechanism addresses the challenge of identifying semantically relevant knowledge that lacks explicit structural connections. While structural navigation excels at following explicit relationships, it may miss relevant content that is semantically related but not directly connected in the graph topology. To bridge this gap, we conduct dense vector similarity search between the query embedding $\\mathbf { e } _ { q }$ and all components stored in embedding table $\\tau$ . \n\nThis approach encompasses atomic content chunks across all modalities, graph entities, and relationship representations, enabling fine-grained semantic matching that can surface relevant knowledge even when traditional lexical or structural signals are absent. The learned embedding space captures nuanced semantic relationships and contextual similarities that complement the explicit structural signals from the navigation mechanism. This retrieval pathway returns the top- $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot \\mathbf { k }$ most semantically similar chunks $\\mathcal { C } _ { \\mathrm { s e m a n } } ( q )$ ranked by cosine similarity scores, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both structurally and semantically relevant knowledge. \n\nCandidate Pool Unification. Both retrieval pathways may return overlapping candidates with differing relevance signals. This necessitates a principled approach to unify and rank results. Retrieval candidates from both pathways are unified into a comprehensive candidate pool: $\\mathcal { C } ( q ) = \\mathcal { C } _ { \\mathrm { s t r u } } ( q ) \\cup$ $\\mathcal { C } _ { \\mathrm { s e m a n } } ( q )$ . Simply merging candidates would ignore distinct evidence each pathway provides. It would fail to account for redundancy between retrieved content. \n\n• (i) Multi-Signal Fusion Scoring. To address these challenges, we apply a sophisticated fusion scoring mechanism integrating multiple complementary relevance signals. These include structural importance derived from graph topology, semantic similarity scores from embedding space, and queryinferred modality preferences obtained through lexical analysis. This multi-faceted scoring approach ensures that final ranked candidates $\\mathcal { C } ^ { \\star } ( q )$ effectively balance structural knowledge relationships with semantic relevance while appropriately weighting different modalities based on query characteristics. \n\n• (ii) Hybrid Retrieval Integration. The resulting hybrid retrieval mechanism enables our framework to leverage the complementary strengths of both knowledge graphs and dense representations. This provides comprehensive coverage of relevant multimodal knowledge for response generation. \n\n2.4 FROM RETRIEVAL TO SYNTHESIS \n\nEffective multimodal question answering requires preserving rich visual semantics while maintaining coherent grounding across heterogeneous knowledge sources. Simple text-only approaches lose crucial visual information, while naive multimodal methods struggle with coherent cross-modal integration. Our synthesis stage addresses these challenges by systematically combining retrieved multimodal knowledge into comprehensive, evidence-grounded responses. \n\n• (i) Building Textual Context. Given the top-ranked retrieval candidates $\\mathcal { C } ^ { \\star } ( q )$ , we construct a structured textual context. We concatenate textual representations of all retrieved components, including entity summaries, relationship descriptions, and chunk contents. The concatenation incorporates appropriate delimiters to indicate modality types and hierarchical origins. This approach ensures the language model\n```",

Tables are parsed into structured cells with headers and values. Mathematical expressions are converted into symbolic representations. The resulting $x _ { j }$ preserves both content and structural context within the source. This provides a faithful, modalityconsistent representation. The decomposition abstracts diverse file formats into atomic units while maintaining their hierarchical order and contextual relationships. This canonicalization enables uniform processing, indexing, and retrieval of multimodal content within our framework. \n\n2.2.1 DUAL-GRAPH CONSTRUCTION FOR MULTIMODAL KNOWLEDGE \n\nWhile multimodal knowledge unification provides a uniform abstraction across modalities, directly constructing a single unified graph often risks overlooking modality-specific structural signals. The proposed RAG-Anything addresses this challenge through a dual-graph construction strategy. The system first builds a cross-modal knowledge graph that faithfully grounds non-textual modalities within their contextual environment. It then constructs a text-based knowledge graph using established text-centric extraction pipelines. These complementary graphs are merged through entity alignment. This design ensures accurate cross-modal grounding and comprehensive coverage of textual semantics, enabling richer knowledge representation and robust retrieval. \n\n• Cross-Modal Knowledge Graph: Non-textual content like images, tables, and equations contains rich semantic information that traditional text-only approaches often overlook. To preserve this knowledge, RAG-Anything constructs a multimodal knowledge graph where non-text atomic units are transformed into structured graph entities. RAG-Anything leverages multimodal large language models to derive two complementary textual representations from each atomic content unit. The first is a detailed description $d _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { c h u n k } }$ optimized for cross-modal retrieval. The second is an entity summar y eentity c ontaining key attributes such as entity name, type, and description for graph construction. The generation process is context-aware, processing each unit with its local neighborhood $C _ { j } = \\{ c _ { k } \\ | \\ | k - j | \\leq \\delta \\}$ , where $\\delta$ controls the contextual window size. This ensures representations accurately reflect each unit’s role within the broader document structure. \n\nBuilding on these textual representations, RAG-Anything constructs the graph structure using nontext units as anchor points. For each non-text unit $c _ { j }$ , the graph extraction routine $R ( \\cdot )$ processes its description $d _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { c h u n k } }$ to identify fine-grained entities and relations: \n\nwhere $\\nu _ { j }$ and $\\mathcal { E } _ { j }$ denote the sets of intra-chunk entities and their relations, respectively. Each atomic non-text unit is associated with a multimodal entity node $v _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { m m } }$ that serves as an anchor for \n\nits intra-chunk entities through explicit belongs_to edges: \n\nThis construction preserves modality-specific grounding while ensuring non-textual content is contextualized by its textual neighborhood. This enables reliable cross-modal retrieval and reasoning. \n\n• Text-based Knowledge Graph: For text modality chunks, we construct a traditional text-based knowledge graph following established methodologies similar to LightRAG (Guo et al., 2024) and GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024). The extraction process operates directly on textual content $x _ { j }$ where $t _ { j } =$ text, leveraging named entity recognition and relation extraction techniques to identify entities and their semantic relationships. Given the rich semantic information inherent in textual content, multimodal context integration is not required for this component. The resulting text-based knowledge graph captures explicit knowledge and semantic connections present in textual portions of documents, complementing the multimodal graph’s cross-modal grounding capabilities. \n\n2.2.2 GRAPH FUSION AND INDEX CREATION \n\nThe separate cross-modal and text-based knowledge graphs capture complementary aspects of document semantics. Integrating them creates a unified representation leveraging visual-textual associations and fine-grained textual relationships for enhanced retrieval. \n\n• (i) Entity Alignment and Graph Fusion. To create a unified knowledge representation, we merge the multimodal knowledge graph $( \\tilde { V } , \\tilde { E } )$ and text-based knowledge graph through entity alignment. This process uses entity names as primary matching keys to identify semantically equivalent entities across both graph structures. The integration consolidates their representations, creating a comprehensive knowledge graph $\\mathcal { G } = ( \\nu , \\mathcal { E } )$ . This graph captures both multimodal contextual relationships and text-based semantic connections. The merged graph provides a holistic view of the document collection. This enables effective retrieval by leveraging visual-textual associations from the multimodal graph and fine-grained textual knowledge relationships from the text-based graph. \n\n• (ii) Dense Representation Generation. To enable efficient similarity-based retrieval, we construct a comprehensive embedding table $\\tau$ that encompasses all components generated during the indexing process. We encode dense representations for all graph entities, relationships, and atomic content chunks across modalities using an appropriate encoder. This creates a unified embedding space where each component $s \\in$ entities, relations, chunks is mapped to its corresponding dense representation: \n\nwhere $\\mathrm { e m b } ( \\cdot )$ denotes the embedding function tailored for each component type. Together, the unified knowledge graph $\\mathcal { G }$ and the embedding table $\\tau$ constitute the complete retrieval index ${ \\mathcal { T } } = ( { \\mathcal { G } } , { \\mathcal { T } } )$ . This provides both structural knowledge representation and dense vector space for efficient cross-modal similarity search during the subsequent retrieval stage. \n\n2.3 CROSS-MODAL HYBRID RETRIEVAL \n\nThe retrieval stage operates on the index $\\mathcal { I } = ( \\\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both crossmodal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything. \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding the knowledge boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM) beyond their static training limitations Zhang et al. (2025). By enabling dynamic retrieval and incorporation of external knowledge during inference, RAG systems transform static language models into adaptive, knowledge-aware systems. This capability has proven essential for applications requiring up-to-date information, domain-specific knowledge, or factual grounding that extends beyond pre-training corpora. \n\nHowever, existing RAG frameworks focus exclusively on text-only knowledge while neglecting the rich multimodal information present in real-world documents. This limitation fundamentally misaligns with how information exists in authentic environments. Real-world knowledge repositories are inherently heterogeneous and multimodal Abootorabi et al. (2025). They contain rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions across diverse document formats. This textual assumption forces existing RAG systems to either discard non-textual information entirely or flatten complex multimodal content into inadequate textual approximations. \n\nThe consequences of this limitation become particularly severe in document-intensive domains where multimodal content carries essential meaning. Academic research, financial analysis, and technical documentation represent prime examples of knowledge-rich environments. These domains fundamentally depend on visual and structured information. Critical insights are often encoded exclusively in non-textual formats. Such formats resist meaningful conversion to plain text. \n\nThe consequences of this limitation become particularly severe in knowledge-intensive domains where multimodal content carries essential meaning. Three representative scenarios illustrate the critical need for multimodal RAG capabilities. In Scientific Research, experimental results are primarily communicated through plots, diagrams, and statistical visualizations. These contain core discoveries that remain invisible to text-only systems. Financial Analysis relies heavily on market charts, correlation matrices, and performance tables. Investment insights are encoded in visual patterns rather than textual descriptions. Additionally, Medical Literature Analysis depends on radiological images, diagnostic charts, and clinical data tables. These contain life-critical information essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions. Current RAG frameworks systematically exclude these vital knowledge sources across all three scenarios. This creates fundamental gaps that render them inadequate for real-world applications requiring comprehensive information understanding. Therefore, multimodal RAG emerges as a critical advancement. It is necessary to bridge these knowledge gaps and enable truly comprehensive intelligence across all modalities of human knowledge representation. \n\nAddressing multimodal RAG presents three fundamental technical challenges that demand principled solutions. This makes it significantly more complex than traditional text-only approaches. The naive solution of converting all multimodal content to textual descriptions introduces severe information loss. Visual elements such as charts, diagrams, and spatial layouts contain semantic richness that cannot be adequately captured through text alone. These inherent limitations necessitate the design of effective technical components. Such components must be specifically designed to handle multimodal complexity and preserve the full spectrum of information contained within diverse content types. \n\nTechnical Challenges. • First, the unified multimodal representation challenge requires seamlessly integrating diverse information types. The system must preserve their unique characteristics and cross-modal relationships. This demands advanced multimodal encoders that can capture both intra-modal and inter-modal dependencies without losing essential visual semantics. • Second, the structure-aware decomposition challenge demands intelligent parsing of complex layouts. The system must maintain spatial and hierarchical relationships crucial for understanding. This requires specialized layout-aware parsing modules that can interpret document structure and preserve contextual positioning of multimodal elements. • Third, the cross-modal retrieval challenge necessitates sophisticated mechanisms that can navigate between different modalities. These mechanisms must reason over their interconnections during retrieval. This calls for cross-modal alignment systems capable of understanding semantic correspondences across text, images, and structured data. These challenges are amplified in long-context scenarios. Relevant evidence is dispersed across multiple modalities and sections, requiring coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous information sources. \n\nOur Contributions. To address these challenges, we introduce RAG-Anything, a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines multimodal knowledge representation and retrieval. Our approach employs a dual-graph construction strategy that elegantly bridges the gap between cross-modal understanding and fine-grained textual semantics. Rather than forcing diverse modalities into textcentric pipelines, RAG-Anything constructs complementary knowledge graphs that preserve both multimodal contextual relationships and detailed textual knowledge. This design enables seamless integration of visual elements, structured data, and mathematical expressions within a unified retrieval framework. The system maintains semantic integrity across modalities while ensuring efficient\n```",

Our approach employs a dual-graph construction strategy that elegantly bridges the gap between cross-modal understanding and fine-grained textual semantics. Rather than forcing diverse modalities into textcentric pipelines, RAG-Anything constructs complementary knowledge graphs that preserve both multimodal contextual relationships and detailed textual knowledge. This design enables seamless integration of visual elements, structured data, and mathematical expressions within a unified retrieval framework. The system maintains semantic integrity across modalities while ensuring efficient cross-modal reasoning capabilities throughout the process. \n\nOur cross-modal hybrid retrieval mechanism strategically combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic similarity matching. This architecture addresses the fundamental limitation of existing approaches that rely solely on embedding-based retrieval or keyword matching. RAG-Anything leverages explicit graph relationships to capture multi-hop reasoning patterns. It simultaneously employs dense vector representations to identify semantically relevant content that lacks direct structural connections. The framework introduces modality-aware query processing and cross-modal alignment systems. These enable textual queries to effectively access visual and structured information. This unified approach eliminates the architectural fragmentation that plagues current multimodal RAG systems. It delivers superior performance particularly on long-context documents where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities and document sections. \n\nExperimental Validation. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging multimodal benchmarks: DocBench and MMLongBench. Our evaluation demonstrates that RAG-Anything achieves superior performance across diverse domains. The framework represents substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, our performance gains become increasingly significant as content length increases. We observe particularly pronounced advantages on long-context materials. This validates our core hypothesis that dual-graph construction and cross-modal hybrid retrieval are essential for handling complex multimodal materials. Our ablation studies reveal that graph-based knowledge representation provides the primary performance gains. Traditional chunk-based approaches fail to capture the structural relationships critical for multimodal reasoning. Case studies further demonstrate that our framework excels at precise localization within complex layouts. The system effectively disambiguates similar terminology and navigates multi-panel visualizations through structure-aware retrieval mechanisms. \n\n2 THE RAG-ANYTHING FRAMEWORK \n\n2.1 PRELIMINARY \n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for dynamically expanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs. While LLMs demonstrate exceptional reasoning capabilities, their knowledge remains static and bounded by training data cutoffs. This creates an ever-widening gap with the rapidly evolving information landscape. RAG systems address this critical limitation by enabling LLMs to retrieve and incorporate external knowledge sources during inference. This transforms them from static repositories into adaptive, knowledge-aware systems. \n\nThe Multimodal Reality: Beyond Text-Only RAG. Current RAG systems face a critical limitation that severely restricts their real-world deployment. Existing frameworks operate under the restrictive assumption that knowledge corpus consists exclusively of plain textual documents. This assumption fundamentally misaligns with how information exists in authentic environments. Real-world knowledge repositories are inherently heterogeneous and multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured data, and mathematical expressions. These diverse knowledge sources span multiple document formats and presentation mediums, from research papers and technical slides to web pages and interactive documents. \n\n2.1.1 MOTIVATING RAG-ANYTHING \n\nThis multimodal reality introduces fundamental technical challenges that expose the inadequacy of current text-only RAG approaches. Effective multimodal RAG requires unified indexing strategies that can handle disparate data types, cross-modal retrieval mechanisms that preserve semantic relationships across modalities, and sophisticated synthesis techniques that can coherently integrate diverse information sources. These challenges demand a fundamentally different architectural approach rather than incremental improvements to existing systems. \n\nThe RAG-Anything framework introduces a unified approach for retrieving and processing knowledge from heterogeneous multimodal information sources. Our system addresses the fundamental challenge of handling diverse data modalities and document formats within a retrieval pipeline. The framework comprises three core components: universal indexing for multimodal knowledge, cross-modal adaptive retrieval, and knowledge-enhanced response generation. This integrated design enables effective knowledge utilization across modalities while maintaining computational efficiency. \n\n2.2 UNIVERSAL REPRESENTATION FOR HETEROGENEOUS KNOWLEDGE \n\nA key requirement for universal knowledge access is the ability to represent heterogeneous multimodal content in a unified, retrieval-oriented abstraction. Unlike existing pipelines that simply parse documents into text segments, RAG-Anything introduces Multimodal Knowledge Unification. This process decomposes raw inputs into atomic knowledge units while preserving their structural context and semantic alignment. For instance, RAG-Anything ensures that figures remain grounded in their captions, equations remain linked to surrounding definitions, and tables stay connected to explanatory narratives. This transforms heterogeneous files into a coherent substrate for cross-modal retrieval. \n\nFormally, each knowledge source $k _ { i } \\in \\mathcal { K }$ (e.g., a web page) is decomposed into atomic content units: \n\nwhere each unit $c _ { j }$ consists of a modality type $t _ { j } \\in$ text, image, table, equation, . . . and its corresponding raw content $x _ { j }$ . The content $x _ { j }$ represents the extracted information from the original knowledge source, processed in a modality-aware manner to preserve semantic integrity. \n\nTo ensure high-fidelity extraction, RAG-Anything leverages specialized parsers for different content types. Text is segmented into coherent paragraphs or list items. Figures are extracted with associated metadata such as captions and cross-references. Tables are parsed into structured cells with headers and values. Mathematical expressions are converted into symbolic representations. The resulting $x _ { j }$ preserves both content and structural context within the source. This provides a faithful, modalityconsistent representation. The decomposition abstracts diverse file formats into atomic units while maintaining their hierarchical order and contextual relationships. This canonicalization enables uniform processing, indexing, and retrieval of multimodal content within our framework. \n\n2.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

This provides both structural knowledge representation and dense vector space for efficient cross-modal similarity search during the subsequent retrieval stage. \n\n2.3 CROSS-MODAL HYBRID RETRIEVAL \n\nThe retrieval stage operates on the index $\\mathcal { I } = ( \\mathcal { G } , \\mathcal { T } )$ to identify relevant knowledge components for a given user query. Traditional RAG methods face significant limitations when dealing with multimodal documents. They typically rely on semantic similarity within single modalities and fail to capture the rich interconnections between visual, mathematical, tabular, and textual elements. To address these challenges, our framework introduces a cross-modal hybrid retrieval mechanism. This mechanism leverages structural knowledge and semantic representations across heterogeneous modalities. \n\nModality-Aware Query Encoding. Given a user query $q$ , we first perform modality-aware query analysis to extract lexical cues and potential modality preferences embedded within the query. For instance, queries containing terms such as \"figure,\" \"chart,\" \"table,\" or \"equation\" provide explicit signals about the expected modality of relevant information. We then compute a unified text embedding ${ \\mathbf { e } _ { q } }$ using the same encoder employed during indexing, ensuring consistency between query and knowledge representations. This embedding-based approach enables cross-modal retrieval capabilities where textual queries can effectively access multimodal content through their shared representations, maintaining retrieval consistency while preserving cross-modal accessibility. \n\nHybrid Knowledge Retrieval Architecture. Recognizing that knowledge relevance manifests through both explicit structural connections and implicit semantic relationships, we design a hybrid retrieval architecture that strategically combines two complementary mechanisms. \n\n• (i) Structural Knowledge Navigation. This mechanism addresses the challenge of capturing explicit relationships and multi-hop reasoning patterns. Traditional keyword-based retrieval often fails to identify knowledge connected through intermediate entities or cross-modal relationships. To overcome this limitation, we exploit the structural properties encoded within our unified knowledge graph G. We employ keyword matching and entity recognition to locate relevant graph components. The retrieval process begins with exact entity matching against query terms. \n\nWe then perform strategic neighborhood expansion to include related entities and relationships within a specified hop distance. This structural approach proves particularly effective at uncovering highlevel semantic connections and entity-relation patterns that span multiple modalities. It capitalizes on the rich cross-modal linkages established in our multimodal knowledge graph. The structural navigation yields candidate set $\\mathcal { C } _ { \\mathrm { s t r u } } ( { q } )$ containing relevant entities, relationships, and their associated content chunks that provide comprehensive contextual information. \n\n• (ii) Semantic Similarity Matching. This mechanism addresses the challenge of identifying semantically relevant knowledge that lacks explicit structural connections. While structural navigation excels at following explicit relationships, it may miss relevant content that is semantically related but not directly connected in the graph topology. To bridge this gap, we conduct dense vector similarity search between the query embedding $\\mathbf { e } _ { q }$ and all components stored in embedding table $\\tau$ . \n\nThis approach encompasses atomic content chunks across all modalities, graph entities, and relationship representations, enabling fine-grained semantic matching that can surface relevant knowledge even when traditional lexical or structural signals are absent. The learned embedding space captures nuanced semantic relationships and contextual similarities that complement the explicit structural signals from the navigation mechanism. This retrieval pathway returns the top- $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot \\mathbf { k }$ most semantically similar chunks $\\mathcal { C } _ { \\mathrm { s e m a n } } ( q )$ ranked by cosine similarity scores, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both structurally and semantically relevant knowledge. \n\nCandidate Pool Unification. Both retrieval pathways may return overlapping candidates with differing relevance signals. This necessitates a principled approach to unify and rank results. Retrieval candidates from both pathways are unified into a comprehensive candidate pool: $\\mathcal { C } ( q ) = \\mathcal { C } _ { \\mathrm { s t r u } } ( q ) \\cup$ $\\mathcal { C } _ { \\mathrm { s e m a n } } ( q )$ . Simply merging candidates would ignore distinct evidence each pathway provides. It would fail to account for redundancy between retrieved content. \n\n• (i) Multi-Signal Fusion Scoring. To address these challenges, we apply a sophisticated fusion scoring mechanism integrating multiple complementary relevance signals. These include structural importance derived from graph topology, semantic similarity scores from embedding space, and queryinferred modality preferences obtained through lexical analysis. This multi-faceted scoring approach ensures that final ranked candidates $\\mathcal { C } ^ { \\star } ( q )$ effectively balance structural knowledge relationships with semantic relevance while appropriately weighting different modalities based on query characteristics. \n\n• (ii) Hybrid Retrieval Integration. The resulting hybrid retrieval mechanism enables our framework to leverage the complementary strengths of both knowledge graphs and dense representations. This provides comprehensive coverage of relevant multimodal knowledge for response generation. \n\n2.4 FROM RETRIEVAL TO SYNTHESIS \n\nEffective multimodal question answering requires preserving rich visual semantics while maintaining coherent grounding across heterogeneous knowledge sources. Simple text-only approaches lose crucial visual information, while naive multimodal methods struggle with coherent cross-modal integration. Our synthesis stage addresses these challenges by systematically combining retrieved multimodal knowledge into comprehensive, evidence-grounded responses. \n\n• (i) Building Textual Context. Given the top-ranked retrieval candidates $\\mathcal { C } ^ { \\star } ( q )$ , we construct a structured textual context. We concatenate textual representations of all retrieved components, including entity summaries, relationship descriptions, and chunk contents. The concatenation incorporates appropriate delimiters to indicate modality types and hierarchical origins. This approach ensures the language model\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both crossmodal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything. \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding the knowledge boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM) beyond their static training limitations Zhang et al. (2025). By enabling dynamic retrieval and incorporation of external knowledge during inference, RAG systems transform static language models into adaptive, knowledge-aware systems. This capability has proven essential for applications requiring up-to-date information, domain-specific knowledge, or factual grounding that extends beyond pre-training corpora. \n\nHowever, existing RAG frameworks focus exclusively on text-only knowledge while neglecting the rich multimodal information present in real-world documents. This limitation fundamentally misaligns with how information exists in authentic environments. Real-world knowledge repositories are inherently heterogeneous and multimodal Abootorabi et al. (2025). They contain rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions across diverse document formats. This textual assumption forces existing RAG systems to either discard non-textual information entirely or flatten complex multimodal content into inadequate textual approximations. \n\nThe consequences of this limitation become particularly severe in document-intensive domains where multimodal content carries essential meaning. Academic research, financial analysis, and technical documentation represent prime examples of knowledge-rich environments. These domains fundamentally depend on visual and structured information. Critical insights are often encoded exclusively in non-textual formats. Such formats resist meaningful conversion to plain text. \n\nThe consequences of this limitation become particularly severe in knowledge-intensive domains where multimodal content carries essential meaning. Three representative scenarios illustrate the critical need for multimodal RAG capabilities. In Scientific Research, experimental results are primarily communicated through plots, diagrams, and statistical visualizations. These contain core discoveries that remain invisible to text-only systems. Financial Analysis relies heavily on market charts, correlation matrices, and performance tables. Investment insights are encoded in visual patterns rather than textual descriptions. Additionally, Medical Literature Analysis depends on radiological images, diagnostic charts, and clinical data tables. These contain life-critical information essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions. Current RAG frameworks systematically exclude these vital knowledge sources across all three scenarios. This creates fundamental gaps that render them inadequate for real-world applications requiring comprehensive information understanding. Therefore, multimodal RAG emerges as a critical advancement. It is necessary to bridge these knowledge gaps and enable truly comprehensive intelligence across all modalities of human knowledge representation. \n\nAddressing multimodal RAG presents three fundamental technical challenges that demand principled solutions. This makes it significantly more complex than traditional text-only approaches. The naive solution of converting all multimodal content to textual descriptions introduces severe information loss. Visual elements such as charts, diagrams, and spatial layouts contain semantic richness that cannot be adequately captured through text alone. These inherent limitations necessitate the design of effective technical components. Such components must be specifically designed to handle multimodal complexity and preserve the full spectrum of information contained within diverse content types. \n\nTechnical Challenges. • First, the unified multimodal representation challenge requires seamlessly integrating diverse information types. The system must preserve their unique characteristics and cross-modal relationships. This demands advanced multimodal encoders that can capture both intra-modal and inter-modal dependencies without losing essential visual semantics. • Second, the structure-aware decomposition challenge demands intelligent parsing of complex layouts. The system must maintain spatial and hierarchical relationships crucial for understanding. This requires specialized layout-aware parsing modules that can interpret document structure and preserve contextual positioning of multimodal elements. • Third, the cross-modal retrieval challenge necessitates sophisticated mechanisms that can navigate between different modalities. These mechanisms must reason over their interconnections during retrieval. This calls for cross-modal alignment systems capable of understanding semantic correspondences across text, images, and structured data. These challenges are amplified in long-context scenarios. Relevant evidence is dispersed across multiple modalities and sections, requiring coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous information sources. \n\nOur Contributions. To address these challenges, we introduce RAG-Anything, a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines multimodal knowledge representation and retrieval. Our approach employs a dual-graph construction strategy that elegantly bridges the gap between cross-modal understanding and fine-grained textual semantics. Rather than forcing diverse modalities into textcentric pipelines, RAG-Anything constructs complementary knowledge graphs that preserve both multimodal contextual relationships and detailed textual knowledge. This design enables seamless integration of visual elements, structured data, and mathematical expressions within a unified retrieval framework.

Given the top-ranked retrieval candidates $\\mathcal { C } ^ { \\star } ( q )$ , we construct a structured textual context. We concatenate textual representations of all retrieved components, including entity summaries, relationship descriptions, and chunk contents. The concatenation incorporates appropriate delimiters to indicate modality types and hierarchical origins. This approach ensures the language model can effectively parse and reason over heterogeneous knowledge components. \n\n• (ii) Recovering Visual Content. For multimodal chunks corresponding to visual artifacts, we perform dereferencing to recover original visual content, creating $\\mathcal { V } ^ { \\star } ( q )$ . This design maintains consistency with our unified embedding strategy. Textual proxies enable efficient retrieval while authentic visual content provides rich semantics necessary for sophisticated reasoning during synthesis. \n\nThe synthesis process jointly conditions on both the assembled comprehensive textual context and dereferenced visual artifacts using a vision-language model: \n\nwhere the VLM integrates information from query, textual context, and visual content. This unified conditioning enables sophisticated visual interpretation while maintaining grounding in retrieved evidence. The resulting responses are both visually informed and factually grounded. \n\n3 EVALUATION \n\n3.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS \n\nEvaluation Datasets. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two challenging multimodal Document Question Answering (DQA) benchmarks that reflect real-world complexity and diversity. DocBench (Zou et al., 2024) provides a rigorous testbed with 229 multimodal documents spanning five critical domains: Academia, Finance, Government, Laws, and News. The dataset includes 1,102 expert-crafted question-answer pairs. These documents are notably extensive, averaging 66 pages and approximately 46,377 tokens, which presents substantial challenges for long-context understanding. \n\nMMLongBench (Ma et al., 2024) complements this evaluation by focusing specifically on longcontext multimodal document comprehension. It features 135 documents across 7 diverse document types with 1,082 expert-annotated questions. Together, these benchmarks provide comprehensive coverage of the multimodal document understanding challenges that RAG-Anything aims to address. They ensure our evaluation captures both breadth across domains and depth in document complexity. Detailed dataset statistics and characteristics are provided in Appendix A.1. \n\nBaselines. We compare RAG-Anything against the following methods for performance evaluation: \n\n• GPT-4o-mini: A powerful multimodal language model with native text and image understanding capabilities. Its 128K token context window enables direct processing of entire documents. We evaluate this model as a strong baseline for long-context multimodal understanding. • LightRAG (Guo et al., 2024): A graph-enhanced RAG system that integrates structured knowledge representation with dual-level retrieval mechanisms. It captures both fine-grained entity-relation information and broader semantic context, improving retrieval precision and response coherence. • MMGraphRAG (Wan & Yu, 2025): A multimodal retrieval framework that constructs unified knowledge graphs spanning textual and visual content. This method employs spectral clustering for multimodal entity analysis and retrieves context along reasoning paths to guide generation. \n\nExperimental Settings. In our experiments, we implement all baselines using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone LLM. Documents are parsed using MinerU (Wang et al., 2024) to extract text, images, tables, and equations for downstream RAG processing. For the retrieval pipeline, we employ the text-embedding-3-large model with 3072-dimensional embeddings. We use the bge-reranker-v2-m3 model for reranking. For graph-based RAG methods, we enforce a combined entity-and-relation token limit of 20,000 tokens and a chunk token limit of 12,000 tokens. \n\nOutputs are constrained to a one-sentence format. For the baseline GPT-4o-mini in our QA scenario, documents are concatenated into image form with a maximum of 50 pages per document, rendered at $1 4 4 \\mathrm { d p i }$ . Finally, all query results are evaluated for accuracy by GPT-4o-mini. \n\n3.2 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON \n\nSuperior Performance and Cross-Domain Generalization. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior overall performance over baselines through its unified multimodal framework. Unlike LightRAG, which is restricted to text-only content processing, RAG-Anything treats text, images, tables, and equations as first-class entities. MMGraphRAG only adds basic image processing while treating tables and equations as plain text, missing crucial structural information. RAG-Anything introduces a comprehensive dual-graph construction strategy that preserves structural relationships across all modalities. This unified approach enables superior performance across both evaluation benchmarks. \n\nEnhanced Long-Context Performance. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on long-context documents. The framework excels where relevant evidence is dispersed across multiple modalities and sections. It achieves the best results in information-dense domains such as Research Reports and Financial Reports on MMLongBench. These improvements stem from the structured context injection mechanism. This mechanism integrates dual-graph construction for cross-page entity alignment. It combines semantic retrieval with structural navigation. The framework also employs modality-aware processing for efficient context window utilization. Unlike baselines that cannot uniformly process diverse modalities, RAG-Anything effectively captures scattered multimodal evidence. Its cross-modal hybrid retrieval architecture combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic similarity matching. This enables the framework to leverage both explicit relationships and implicit semantic connections across modalities. \n\nTo systematically evaluate model performance across varying document lengths, we conducted comprehensive experiments on both datasets. As illustrated in Figure 2, RAG-Anything and MMGraphRAG exhibit comparable performance on shorter documents. However, RAG-Anything’s advantages become increasingly pronounced as document length grows. On DocBench, the performance gap expands dramatically to over\n```",

Given the top-ranked retrieval candidates $\\mathcal { C } ^ { \\star } ( q )$ , we construct a structured textual context. We concatenate textual representations of all retrieved components, including entity summaries, relationship descriptions, and chunk contents. The concatenation incorporates appropriate delimiters to indicate modality types and hierarchical origins. This approach ensures the language model can effectively parse and reason over heterogeneous knowledge components. \n\n• (ii) Recovering Visual Content. For multimodal chunks corresponding to visual artifacts, we perform dereferencing to recover original visual content, creating $\\mathcal { V } ^ { \\star } ( q )$ . This design maintains consistency with our unified embedding strategy. Textual proxies enable efficient retrieval while authentic visual content provides rich semantics necessary for sophisticated reasoning during synthesis. \n\nThe synthesis process jointly conditions on both the assembled comprehensive textual context and dereferenced visual artifacts using a vision-language model: \n\nwhere the VLM integrates information from query, textual context, and visual content. This unified conditioning enables sophisticated visual interpretation while maintaining grounding in retrieved evidence. The resulting responses are both visually informed and factually grounded. \n\n3 EVALUATION \n\n3.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS \n\nEvaluation Datasets. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two challenging multimodal Document Question Answering (DQA) benchmarks that reflect real-world complexity and diversity. DocBench (Zou et al., 2024) provides a rigorous testbed with 229 multimodal documents spanning five critical domains: Academia, Finance, Government, Laws, and News. The dataset includes 1,102 expert-crafted question-answer pairs. These documents are notably extensive, averaging 66 pages and approximately 46,377 tokens, which presents substantial challenges for long-context understanding. \n\nMMLongBench (Ma et al., 2024) complements this evaluation by focusing specifically on longcontext multimodal document comprehension. It features 135 documents across 7 diverse document types with 1,082 expert-annotated questions. Together, these benchmarks provide comprehensive coverage of the multimodal document understanding challenges that RAG-Anything aims to address. They ensure our evaluation captures both breadth across domains and depth in document complexity. Detailed dataset statistics and characteristics are provided in Appendix A.1. \n\nBaselines. We compare RAG-Anything against the following methods for performance evaluation: \n\n• GPT-4o-mini: A powerful multimodal language model with native text and image understanding capabilities. Its 128K token context window enables direct processing of entire documents. We evaluate this model as a strong baseline for long-context multimodal understanding. • LightRAG (Guo et al., 2024): A graph-enhanced RAG system that integrates structured knowledge representation with dual-level retrieval mechanisms. It captures both fine-grained entity-relation information and broader semantic context, improving retrieval precision and response coherence. • MMGraphRAG (Wan & Yu, 2025): A multimodal retrieval framework that constructs unified knowledge graphs spanning textual and visual content. This method employs spectral clustering for multimodal entity analysis and retrieves context along reasoning paths to guide generation. \n\nExperimental Settings. In our experiments, we implement all baselines using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone LLM. Documents are parsed using MinerU (Wang et al., 2024) to extract text, images, tables, and equations for downstream RAG processing. For the retrieval pipeline, we employ the text-embedding-3-large model with 3072-dimensional embeddings. We use the bge-reranker-v2-m3 model for reranking. For graph-based RAG methods, we enforce a combined entity-and-relation token limit of 20,000 tokens and a chunk token limit of 12,000 tokens. \n\nOutputs are constrained to a one-sentence format. For the baseline GPT-4o-mini in our QA scenario, documents are concatenated into image form with a maximum of 50 pages per document, rendered at $1 4 4 \\mathrm { d p i }$ . Finally, all query results are evaluated for accuracy by GPT-4o-mini. \n\n3.2 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON \n\nSuperior Performance and Cross-Domain Generalization. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior overall performance over baselines through its unified multimodal framework. Unlike LightRAG, which is restricted to text-only content processing, RAG-Anything treats text, images, tables, and equations as first-class entities. MMGraphRAG only adds basic image processing while treating tables and equations as plain text, missing crucial structural information. RAG-Anything introduces a comprehensive dual-graph construction strategy that preserves structural relationships across all modalities. This unified approach enables superior performance across both evaluation benchmarks. \n\nEnhanced Long-Context Performance. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on long-context documents. The framework excels where relevant evidence is dispersed across multiple modalities and sections. It achieves the best results in information-dense domains such as Research Reports and Financial Reports on MMLongBench. These improvements stem from the structured context injection mechanism. This mechanism integrates dual-graph construction for cross-page entity alignment. It combines semantic retrieval with structural navigation. The framework also employs modality-aware processing for efficient context window utilization. Unlike baselines that cannot uniformly process diverse modalities, RAG-Anything effectively captures scattered multimodal evidence. Its cross-modal hybrid retrieval architecture combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic similarity matching. This enables the framework to leverage both explicit relationships and implicit semantic connections across modalities. \n\nTo systematically evaluate model performance across varying document lengths, we conducted comprehensive experiments on both datasets. As illustrated in Figure 2, RAG-Anything and MMGraphRAG exhibit comparable performance on shorter documents. However, RAG-Anything’s advantages become increasingly pronounced as document length grows. On DocBench, the performance gap expands dramatically to over\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

Two fundamental issues emerge through systematic failure case examination. First, systems exhibit text-centric retrieval bias, preferentially accessing textual sources even when queries explicitly require visual information. Second, rigid spatial processing patterns fail to adapt to non-standard document layouts. These limitations manifest in cross-modal misalignment scenarios and structurally ambiguous tables. The findings highlight the need for adaptive spatial reasoning and layout-aware parsing mechanisms to handle real-world multimodal document complexity.\n```",

This enables the framework to leverage both explicit relationships and implicit semantic connections across modalities. \n\nTo systematically evaluate model performance across varying document lengths, we conducted comprehensive experiments on both datasets. As illustrated in Figure 2, RAG-Anything and MMGraphRAG exhibit comparable performance on shorter documents. However, RAG-Anything’s advantages become increasingly pronounced as document length grows. On DocBench, the performance gap expands dramatically to over 13 points for documents exceeding 100 pages ( $6 8 . 2 \\%$ vs. \n\n$5 4 . 6 \\%$ for 101–200 pages; $6 8 . 8 \\%$ vs. $5 5 . 0 \\%$ for $^ { 2 0 0 + }$ pages). On MMLongBench, RAG-Anything demonstrates consistent improvements across all length categories, achieving accuracy gains of 3.4 points for 11–50 pages, 9.3 points for 51–100 pages, and 7.9 points for 101–200 pages. These findings confirm that our dual-graph construction and cross-modal hybrid retrieval mechanism is particularly effective for long-document reasoning tasks. \n\n3.3 ARCHITECTURAL VALIDATION WITH ABLATION STUDIES\n\nTo isolate and quantify the contributions of key architectural components in RAG-Anything, we conducted systematic ablation studies examining two critical design choices. Given that our approach fundamentally differs from existing methods through dual-graph construction and hybrid retrieval, we specifically evaluated: i) Chunk-only, which bypasses graph construction entirely and relies solely on traditional chunk-based retrieval, and ii) w/o Reranker, which eliminates the cross-modal reranking component while preserving the core graph-based architecture. \n\nAs demonstrated in Table 4, the results validate our architectural design through striking performance variations. • Graph Construction is Essential. The chunk-only variant achieves merely $6 0 . 0 \\%$ accuracy with substantial cross-domain drops. This demonstrates that traditional chunking fails to capture structural and cross-modal relationships essential for multimodal documents. • Reranking Provides Marginal Gains. Removing the reranker yields only a modest decline to $6 2 . 4 \\%$ , while the full model achieves $6 3 . 4 \\%$ accuracy. This indicates that cross-modal reranking provides valuable refinement, but primary gains stem from our graph-based retrieval and cross-modal integration. \n\n3.4 CASE STUDIES \n\nMultimodal documents contain rich structural information within each modality. Understanding these intra-modal structures is crucial for accurate reasoning. We analyze two representative cases from DocBench to demonstrate how RAG-Anything leverages these structures. These cases highlight a key limitation of existing methods. Baselines either rely on superficial textual cues or flatten complex visual elements into plain text. In contrast, RAG-Anything builds modality-aware graphs that preserve essential relationships (e.g., table header cell unit edges; panel caption axis edges). This enables precise reasoning over complex document layouts. \n\n• Case 1: Multi-panel Figure Interpretation. This case examines a common scenario in academic literature. Researchers often need to compare results across different experimental conditions. These results are typically presented in multi-panel visualizations. Figure 3 shows a challenging t-SNE \n\nGPT-4o-mini??: \n\nAccording to Figure 2, the VAE model's style space shows a clearer separation between different styles. \n\nMMGraphRAG??: \n\nAccording to Figure 2, the model's style space shows a clearer separation between different styles in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) compared to the Deterministic Autoencoder (DAE). \n\nLightRAG??：\n\nAccording to Figure 2, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) shows a clearer separation between different styles in its style space compared to the Deterministic Autoencoder (DAE). \n\nRAG-Anything(Correct??): \n\nThe DAE model's style space shows a clearer separation between different styles according to Figure 2. \n\nvisualization with multiple subpanels. The query requires distinguishing between two related but distinct panels. RAG-Anything constructs a visual-layout graph where panels, axis titles, legends, and captions become nodes. Key edges encode semantic relationships. Panels contain specific plots. Captions provide contextual information. Subfigures relate hierarchically. This structure guides the retriever to focus on the style-space panel for comparing cluster separation patterns. The system avoids confusion from the adjacent content space panel. This panel shows less clear distinctions. \n\nGPT-4o-mini??: \n\nNovo Nordisk's total amount spent on wages and salaries in 2020 was DKK 32,928 million. \n\nMMGraphRAG??: \n\nNovo Nordisk spent a total of 11,503 million DKK on wages and salaries in 2020. \n\nLightRAG??：\n\nNovo Nordisk spent DKK 11,503 million on wages and salaries in 2020. \n\nRAG-Anything(Correct??): \n\nNovo Nordisk's total amount spent on wages and salaries in 2020 was DKK 26,778 million. \n\nFigure 4: Financial table navigation case. The query involves locating the specific intersection of “Wages and salaries” row and $\" 2 0 2 0 \"$ column amid similar terminological entries. \n\n• Case 2: Financial Table Navigation. This case addresses a common challenge in financial document analysis. Analysts must extract specific metrics from tables with similar terminology and multiple time periods. Figure 4 shows this scenario. The query involves resolving ambiguous financial terms and selecting the correct column for a specified year. \n\nRAG-Anything transforms the financial report table into a structured graph. Each row header, column header (year), data cell, and unit becomes a node. The edges capture key\n```",

Two fundamental issues emerge through systematic failure case examination. First, systems exhibit text-centric retrieval bias, preferentially accessing textual sources even when queries explicitly require visual information. Second, rigid spatial processing patterns fail to adapt to non-standard document layouts. These limitations manifest in cross-modal misalignment scenarios and structurally ambiguous tables. The findings highlight the need for adaptive spatial reasoning and layout-aware parsing mechanisms to handle real-world multimodal document complexity.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

This enables the framework to leverage both explicit relationships and implicit semantic connections across modalities. \n\nTo systematically evaluate model performance across varying document lengths, we conducted comprehensive experiments on both datasets. As illustrated in Figure 2, RAG-Anything and MMGraphRAG exhibit comparable performance on shorter documents. However, RAG-Anything’s advantages become increasingly pronounced as document length grows. On DocBench, the performance gap expands dramatically to over 13 points for documents exceeding 100 pages ( $6 8 . 2 \\%$ vs. \n\n$5 4 . 6 \\%$ for 101–200 pages; $6 8 . 8 \\%$ vs. $5 5 . 0 \\%$ for $^ { 2 0 0 + }$ pages). On MMLongBench, RAG-Anything demonstrates consistent improvements across all length categories, achieving accuracy gains of 3.4 points for 11–50 pages, 9.3 points for 51–100 pages, and 7.9 points for 101–200 pages. These findings confirm that our dual-graph construction and cross-modal hybrid retrieval mechanism is particularly effective for long-document reasoning tasks. \n\n3.3 ARCHITECTURAL VALIDATION WITH ABLATION STUDIES\n\nTo isolate and quantify the contributions of key architectural components in RAG-Anything, we conducted systematic ablation studies examining two critical design choices. Given that our approach fundamentally differs from existing methods through dual-graph construction and hybrid retrieval, we specifically evaluated: i) Chunk-only, which bypasses graph construction entirely and relies solely on traditional chunk-based retrieval, and ii) w/o Reranker, which eliminates the cross-modal reranking component while preserving the core graph-based architecture. \n\nAs demonstrated in Table 4, the results validate our architectural design through striking performance variations. • Graph Construction is Essential. The chunk-only variant achieves merely $6 0 . 0 \\%$ accuracy with substantial cross-domain drops. This demonstrates that traditional chunking fails to capture structural and cross-modal relationships essential for multimodal documents. • Reranking Provides Marginal Gains. Removing the reranker yields only a modest decline to $6 2 . 4 \\%$ , while the full model achieves $6 3 . 4 \\%$ accuracy. This indicates that cross-modal reranking provides valuable refinement, but primary gains stem from our graph-based retrieval and cross-modal integration. \n\n3.4 CASE STUDIES \n\nMultimodal documents contain rich structural information within each modality. Understanding these intra-modal structures is crucial for accurate reasoning. We analyze two representative cases from DocBench to demonstrate how RAG-Anything leverages these structures. These cases highlight a key limitation of existing methods. Baselines either rely on superficial textual cues or flatten complex visual elements into plain text. In contrast, RAG-Anything builds modality-aware graphs that preserve essential relationships (e.g., table header cell unit edges; panel caption axis edges). This enables precise reasoning over complex document layouts. \n\n• Case 1: Multi-panel Figure Interpretation. This case examines a common scenario in academic literature. Researchers often need to compare results across different experimental conditions. These results are typically presented in multi-panel visualizations. Figure 3 shows a challenging t-SNE \n\nGPT-4o-mini??: \n\nAccording to Figure 2, the VAE model's style space shows a clearer separation between different styles. \n\nMMGraphRAG??: \n\nAccording to Figure 2, the model's style space shows a clearer separation between different styles in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) compared to the Deterministic Autoencoder (DAE). \n\nLightRAG??：\n\nAccording to Figure 2, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) shows a clearer separation between different styles in its style space compared to the Deterministic Autoencoder (DAE). \n\nRAG-Anything(Correct??): \n\nThe DAE model's style space shows a clearer separation between different styles according to Figure 2. \n\nvisualization with multiple subpanels. The query requires distinguishing between two related but distinct panels. RAG-Anything constructs a visual-layout graph where panels, axis titles, legends, and captions become nodes. Key edges encode semantic relationships. Panels contain specific plots. Captions provide contextual information. Subfigures relate hierarchically. This structure guides the retriever to focus on the style-space panel for comparing cluster separation patterns. The system avoids confusion from the adjacent content space panel. This panel shows less clear distinctions. \n\nGPT-4o-mini??: \n\nNovo Nordisk's total amount spent on wages and salaries in 2020 was DKK 32,928 million. \n\nMMGraphRAG??: \n\nNovo Nordisk spent a total of 11,503 million DKK on wages and salaries in 2020. \n\nLightRAG??：\n\nNovo Nordisk spent DKK 11,503 million on wages and salaries in 2020. \n\nRAG-Anything(Correct??): \n\nNovo Nordisk's total amount spent on wages and salaries in 2020 was DKK 26,778 million. \n\nFigure 4: Financial table navigation case. The query involves locating the specific intersection of “Wages and salaries” row and $\" 2 0 2 0 \"$ column amid similar terminological entries. \n\n• Case 2: Financial Table Navigation. This case addresses a common challenge in financial document analysis. Analysts must extract specific metrics from tables with similar terminology and multiple time periods. Figure 4 shows this scenario. The query involves resolving ambiguous financial terms and selecting the correct column for a specified year. \n\nRAG-Anything transforms the financial report table into a structured graph. Each row header, column header (year), data cell, and unit becomes a node. The edges capture key\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

This case addresses a common challenge in financial document analysis. Analysts must extract specific metrics from tables with similar terminology and multiple time periods. Figure 4 shows this scenario. The query involves resolving ambiguous financial terms and selecting the correct column for a specified year. \n\nRAG-Anything transforms the financial report table into a structured graph. Each row header, column header (year), data cell, and unit becomes a node. The edges capture key relationships: row-of, column-of, header-applies-to, and unit-of. This structure enables precise navigation. The retriever focuses on the row “Wages and salaries” and the column for $\" 2 0 2 0 \"$ . It directs attention to the target cell (26,778 million). The system successfully disambiguates nearby entries like “Share-based payments.” Competing methods treat tables as linear text. They often confuse numerical spans and years. This leads to significantly inaccurate answers. RAG-Anything explicitly models relationships within the table. It achieves precise selection and numeric grounding. This ensures accurate responses. \n\n• Key Insights. Both cases demonstrate how RAG-Anything’s structure-aware design delivers targeted advantages. Our approach transforms documents into explicit graph representations. These graphs capture intra-modal relationships that traditional methods miss. In figures, connections between panels, captions, and axes enable panel-level comparisons. This goes beyond keyword matching. In tables, row–column–unit graphs ensure accurate identification through modeling. \n\nThis structure-aware retrieval design reduces confusion from repeated terminology and complex layouts. Traditional RAG systems struggle with these scenarios due to lack of structural understanding. Even MMGraphRAG fails here because it only considers image modality entities. It ignores other modality entities like table cells, row headers, and column headers. RAG-Anything’s comprehensive graph representation captures all modality-specific entities and their relationships. This enables precise, modality-specific grounding that leads to consistent improvements in document Q&A tasks requiring fine-grained localization. Additional cases are available in Appendix A.2. \n\n4 RELATED WORK \n\n• Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Large language models struggle with long-context inputs and multi-hop queries, failing to precisely locate dispersed evidence (Zhang et al., \n\n2025). Graph structures address this limitation by introducing explicit relational modeling, improving both retrieval efficiency and reasoning accuracy (Bei et al., 2025). \n\nSince GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024), research has evolved along two complementary directions. First, graph construction approaches optimize structures for retrieval efficiency, ranging from LightRAG’s (Guo et al., 2024) sparsified indices to neural models like GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) and memory-augmented variants like HippoRAG (Jimenez Gutierrez et al., 2024). Second, knowledge aggregation approaches integrate information for multi-level reasoning through hierarchical methods like RAPTOR (Sarthi et al., 2024) and ArchRAG (Wang et al., 2025). Despite these advances, existing systems remain text-centric with homogeneous inputs. This limits their applicability to multimodal documents and constrains robust reasoning over heterogeneous content. RAG-Anything addresses this gap by extending GraphRAG to all modalities. \n\n• Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Multimodal RAG represents a natural evolution from text-based RAG systems, addressing the need to integrate external knowledge from diverse data modalities for comprehensive response generation (Abootorabi et al., 2025). However, current approaches are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on modality-specific architectures. Existing methods demonstrate these constraints across domains: VideoRAG (Ren et al., 2025) employs dual-channel architectures for video understanding while MM-VID (Lin et al., 2023) converts videos to text, losing visual information; VisRAG (Yu et al., 2025) preserves document layouts as images but misses granular relationships; MMGraphRAG (Wan & Yu, 2025) links scene graphs with textual representations but suffers from structural blindness—treating tables and formulas as plain text without proper entity extraction, losing structural information for reasoning. \n\nThe fundamental problem underlying these limitations is architectural fragmentation. Current systems require specialized processing pipelines for each modality. This creates poor generalizability as new modalities demand custom architectures and fusion mechanisms. Such fragmentation introduces cross-modal alignment difficulties, modality biases, and information bottlenecks. These issues systematically compromise system performance and scalability. RAG-Anything addresses this fragmentation through a unified graph-based framework. Our approach processes all modalities with consistent structured modeling. This eliminates architectural constraints while preserving multimodal information integrity. The result is seamless cross-modal reasoning across heterogeneous content. \n\n5 CONCLUSION \n\nRAG-Anything introduces a paradigm shift in multimodal retrieval through its unified graph-based framework. Our core technical innovation is the dual-graph construction strategy that seamlessly integrates cross-modal and text-based knowledge graphs. Rather than forcing diverse modalities into text-centric pipelines that lose critical structural information, our approach fundamentally reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities with rich semantic relationships. The hybrid retrieval mechanism strategically combines structural navigation with semantic matching, enabling precise reasoning over complex document layouts. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates superior performance on long-context documents, particularly those exceeding 100 pages where traditional methods fail. This work establishes a new foundation for multimodal RAG systems that can handle the heterogeneous nature of diverse information landscapes. \n\nOur analysis in Appendix A.5 reveals critical challenges facing current multimodal RAG systems. Two fundamental issues emerge through systematic failure case examination. First, systems exhibit text-centric retrieval bias, preferentially accessing textual sources even when queries explicitly require visual information. Second, rigid spatial processing patterns fail to adapt to non-standard document layouts. These limitations manifest in cross-modal misalignment scenarios and structurally ambiguous tables. The findings highlight the need for adaptive spatial reasoning and layout\n```",

Each unit $c_j$ is characterized by its modality type $t_j$, which can include text, images, tables, or equations, and its corresponding raw content $x_j$. This decomposition is crucial for the RAG-Anything framework as it facilitates the representation of heterogeneous information in a structured way that maintains the context and relationship between various modalities. The operations include a mapping from a single knowledge source to multiple units, emphasizing the comprehensive understanding of complex multimodal data. This process stands in contrast to traditional text-only approaches, effectively addressing the inherent limitations of capturing rich semantic information when dealing with diverse content types. The equation emphasizes the importance of preserving modality-specific signals while abstracting content for automated systems. The contextually rich representation supports applications in advanced retrieval systems, enhancing cross-modal insights and retrieval accuracy, especially in long-context scenarios. The equation illustrates a foundational component of the framework, linking the technical challenges of multimodal representation to the solution proposed by RAG-Anything, which aims to provide a sophisticated approach to multimodal knowledge indexing and retrieval.\n```",

The diagram is divided into three main sections, each outlined with dashed lines and colored backgrounds for distinction: Multimodal Knowledge Unification, Dual-Graph Construction for Multimodal Knowledge, and the Retrieval and Response Generation process. The leftmost section, 'Multimodal Knowledge Unification', depicts input documents in diverse formats (PPT, DOC, PDF) feeding into a 'Structured Content List'. This list includes processes like hierarchical text extraction, image caption and metadata extraction, LaTeX equation recognition, and table structure parsing. Each modality type is represented visually with small colored boxes showing 'Text Info', 'Image Info', 'Equation Info', and 'Table Info'. The middle section, 'Dual-Graph Construction for Multimodal Knowledge', shows how text info and multimodal info are processed through VLM/LLM (Visual Language Model/Large Language Model) processors into a knowledge graph. It features two small networks: a 'Text-Based Knowledge Graph' on the top, showing nodes labeled like 'Beekeeper' and 'Observer', and a 'Cross-Modal Knowledge Graph' on the bottom, showing nodes with labels 'Parent Node', 'Child Node'. These graphs merge into a 'Merged' graph. Right below, a 'Vector Database' is visualized with layers marked 'Text VDB' and 'Multi-modal VDB'. The rightmost section, 'Query Processing & Response Generation', outlines the flow from query input extraction through 'Hybrid Retrieved Info' with steps like 'Text Encoder', 'Structural Knowledge Navigation', and 'Semantic Similarity Matching', culminating in a response. The visual style includes soft pastel colors, thin lines, and minimalist iconography, ensuring clarity and accessibility.\n```",

Each unit $c_j$ is characterized by its modality type $t_j$, which can include text, images, tables, or equations, and its corresponding raw content $x_j$. This decomposition is crucial for the RAG-Anything framework as it facilitates the representation of heterogeneous information in a structured way that maintains the context and relationship between various modalities. The operations include a mapping from a single knowledge source to multiple units, emphasizing the comprehensive understanding of complex multimodal data. This process stands in contrast to traditional text-only approaches, effectively addressing the inherent limitations of capturing rich semantic information when dealing with diverse content types. The equation emphasizes the importance of preserving modality-specific signals while abstracting content for automated systems. The contextually rich representation supports applications in advanced retrieval systems, enhancing cross-modal insights and retrieval accuracy, especially in long-context scenarios. The equation illustrates a foundational component of the framework, linking the technical challenges of multimodal representation to the solution proposed by RAG-Anything, which aims to provide a sophisticated approach to multimodal knowledge indexing and retrieval.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

In this context, $v _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { mm } }$ represents the multimodal entity nodes that serve as anchors for knowledge graph construction. The union of $\\mathcal { V } _ { j }$, where $j$ indexes different chunks or content units, signifies the inclusion of intra-chunk entities that further enrich the graph structure. The second part of the equation, $$\\tilde { E } = \\bigcup _ { j } \\mathcal { E } _ { j } \\cup \\bigcup _ { j } \\{ ( u \\frac { \\mathrm { ~ belongs\\_to } } { | \\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\phi } } | } \\upsilon _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { mm } } ) : u \\in \\mathcal { V } _ { j } \\},$$ defines the edges of the derived graph by combining intra-chunk relationships $\\mathcal { E } _ { j }$ with a set of belongs_to edges representing the affiliations between different entities and their multimodal representations. The significance of this equation lies in its ability to create a unified graph representation that captures rich semantic information by preserving the relational structure of multimodal data. This approach is essential in the area of multimodal knowledge graph construction and retrieval, as it enables the system to handle diverse data types while maintaining contextual integrity. The theory behind this construction is closely aligned with concepts in graph theory, entity grounding, and multimodal representation, asserting the necessity of capturing both explicit and implicit relationships in knowledge graphs. Practically, it highlights applications in semantic search, improved information retrieval, and enhanced natural language processing where understanding complex relationships across different modalities is critical.\n```",

The diagram is divided into three main sections, each outlined with dashed lines and colored backgrounds for distinction: Multimodal Knowledge Unification, Dual-Graph Construction for Multimodal Knowledge, and the Retrieval and Response Generation process. The leftmost section, 'Multimodal Knowledge Unification', depicts input documents in diverse formats (PPT, DOC, PDF) feeding into a 'Structured Content List'. This list includes processes like hierarchical text extraction, image caption and metadata extraction, LaTeX equation recognition, and table structure parsing. Each modality type is represented visually with small colored boxes showing 'Text Info', 'Image Info', 'Equation Info', and 'Table Info'. The middle section, 'Dual-Graph Construction for Multimodal Knowledge', shows how text info and multimodal info are processed through VLM/LLM (Visual Language Model/Large Language Model) processors into a knowledge graph. It features two small networks: a 'Text-Based Knowledge Graph' on the top, showing nodes labeled like 'Beekeeper' and 'Observer', and a 'Cross-Modal Knowledge Graph' on the bottom, showing nodes with labels 'Parent Node', 'Child Node'. These graphs merge into a 'Merged' graph. Right below, a 'Vector Database' is visualized with layers marked 'Text VDB' and 'Multi-modal VDB'. The rightmost section, 'Query Processing & Response Generation', outlines the flow from query input extraction through 'Hybrid Retrieved Info' with steps like 'Text Encoder', 'Structural Knowledge Navigation', and 'Semantic Similarity Matching', culminating in a response. The visual style includes soft pastel colors, thin lines, and minimalist iconography, ensuring clarity and accessibility.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

Here, \\mathcal V _ { j } denotes a set of vertices (nodes) derived from the atomic unit of knowledge, while \\mathcal E _ { j } denotes the set of edges (relationships) between these entities. The variable d _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { c h u n k } } refers to a generated textual description that encapsulates the contextual semantics of the content unit indexed under the dual-graph methodology proposed in the RAG-Anything framework. The function R ( \\cdot ) is responsible for taking this description and extracting the underlying structure, which includes identifying entities and their interrelations. This approach enhances cross-modal retrieval by ensuring that visual and textual elements are cohesively represented, facilitating integration across diverse data types. The equation holds significant implications in the context of structured knowledge representation, enabling richer interactions between textual and non-textual elements in retrieval systems. Its relationship to concepts like dual-graph construction and entity alignment highlights the system's need for maintaining modality-specific integrity while enabling comprehensive knowledge retrieval. Practically, this equation illustrates the fundamental mechanism by which RAG-Anything transforms heterogeneous knowledge into a unified graph structure, enhancing AI systems' ability to retrieve and reason across multiple modalities in real-world scenarios.\n```",

In this context, $v _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { mm } }$ represents the multimodal entity nodes that serve as anchors for knowledge graph construction. The union of $\\mathcal { V } _ { j }$, where $j$ indexes different chunks or content units, signifies the inclusion of intra-chunk entities that further enrich the graph structure. The second part of the equation, $$\\tilde { E } = \\bigcup _ { j } \\mathcal { E } _ { j } \\cup \\bigcup _ { j } \\{ ( u \\frac { \\mathrm { ~ belongs\\_to } } { | \\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\phi } } | } \\upsilon _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { mm } } ) : u \\in \\mathcal { V } _ { j } \\},$$ defines the edges of the derived graph by combining intra-chunk relationships $\\mathcal { E } _ { j }$ with a set of belongs_to edges representing the affiliations between different entities and their multimodal representations. The significance of this equation lies in its ability to create a unified graph representation that captures rich semantic information by preserving the relational structure of multimodal data. This approach is essential in the area of multimodal knowledge graph construction and retrieval, as it enables the system to handle diverse data types while maintaining contextual integrity. The theory behind this construction is closely aligned with concepts in graph theory, entity grounding, and multimodal representation, asserting the necessity of capturing both explicit and implicit relationships in knowledge graphs. Practically, it highlights applications in semantic search, improved information retrieval, and enhanced natural language processing where understanding complex relationships across different modalities is critical.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

Here, \\mathcal V _ { j } denotes a set of vertices (nodes) derived from the atomic unit of knowledge, while \\mathcal E _ { j } denotes the set of edges (relationships) between these entities. The variable d _ { j } ^ { \\mathrm { c h u n k } } refers to a generated textual description that encapsulates the contextual semantics of the content unit indexed under the dual-graph methodology proposed in the RAG-Anything framework. The function R ( \\cdot ) is responsible for taking this description and extracting the underlying structure, which includes identifying entities and their interrelations. This approach enhances cross-modal retrieval by ensuring that visual and textual elements are cohesively represented, facilitating integration across diverse data types. The equation holds significant implications in the context of structured knowledge representation, enabling richer interactions between textual and non-textual elements in retrieval systems. Its relationship to concepts like dual-graph construction and entity alignment highlights the system's need for maintaining modality-specific integrity while enabling comprehensive knowledge retrieval. Practically, this equation illustrates the fundamental mechanism by which RAG-Anything transforms heterogeneous knowledge into a unified graph structure, enhancing AI systems' ability to retrieve and reason across multiple modalities in real-world scenarios.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

It includes headers such as 'Dataset', indicating the name of the dataset, '# Documents' for the count of documents, '# Avg. Pages' showing the average page length of documents, '# Avg. Tokens' representing the average token count per document, '# Doc Types' indicating the number of document types (notably absent for DocBench), and '# Questions' reflecting the number of questions associated with the datasets. Key data points reveal that DocBench has a larger document count (229) and average token count (46,377), indicating its robustness in capacity. MMLongBench has fewer documents (135) but is characterized by a lower average token count (21,214), which might suggest a focus on varying complexity across fewer, possibly denser, documents with specific document types indicated (57). Patterns show that while DocBench appears to primarily assess general multimodal understanding, MMLongBench appears tailored for long-context comprehension. The absence of document type information for DocBench may indicate a more homogenous set of document types compared to MMLongBench. The significance of this data lies in its direct relation to the context of hybrid knowledge retrieval mechanisms described, as these datasets serve as benchmarks against which the hybrid retrieval strategies are tested, showcasing the performance across domains. Overall, the table highlights how the experiments measure up against substantial challenges in multimodal understanding essential for the synthesis of complex document information, directly correlating with the surrounding context of hybrid retrieval architecture and the need for effective multimodal question answering.\n```",

Here, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\) denotes the set of graph entities, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\) the set of relationships between these entities, and \\\\( c_{j_{j}} \\\\) represents atomic content chunks across different modalities (like text, images, tables, and equations). The function \\\\( \\\\mathrm{emb}(\\cdot) \\\\) is an embedding function that generates a dense vector corresponding to each component \\\\( s \\\\), facilitating similarity searches in the embedding space. This unification cultivates effective retrieval mechanisms by constructing a robust index that captures the semantically rich relationships within multimodal documents. The significance lies in its capacity to encode inherent knowledge connections and enhance cross-modal retrieval through structural and semantic correlations. By combining these sets, the equation establishes a foundation upon which sophisticated retrieval strategies can operate, ensuring that non-textual modalities like images or equations are readily accessible and analyzable alongside textual data. This construction addresses the potential pitfalls in traditional models by maintaining modality-specific attributes while facilitating robust cross-modal relationships. Thus, this equation plays a crucial role in bridging diverse information types in a comprehensive manner, greatly enhancing the retrieval accuracy and effectiveness in multimodal contexts.\n```",

Here, {\\\\mathcal{P}}(q) refers to the structured textual context created from retrieved multimodal chunks, while {\\\\mathcal{V}}^{\\\\star}(q) encompasses the original visual data necessary for coherent synthesis. The operations include retrieving, processing, and integrating both text and visual modalities, which highlights the function of a VLM as it generates a response that is factually grounded. This process underscores the model's capability to bridge structural knowledge derived from the structured context and semantic knowledge captured in the visual input. In this context, the equation serves as a critical component in the broader discussion of hybrid retrieval mechanisms that enhance multimodal question-answering systems, reflecting the intricate balance between semantic and structural understanding of information across modalities. This equation is connected to the theme of hybrid architecture, demonstrating how a VLM synthesizes multimodal knowledge into coherent responses. Practical applications include advanced AI systems in domains like education, where they need to answer complex questions that require understanding both textual and visual data.\n```",

It includes headers such as 'Dataset', indicating the name of the dataset, '# Documents' for the count of documents, '# Avg. Pages' showing the average page length of documents, '# Avg. Tokens' representing the average token count per document, '# Doc Types' indicating the number of document types (notably absent for DocBench), and '# Questions' reflecting the number of questions associated with the datasets. Key data points reveal that DocBench has a larger document count (229) and average token count (46,377), indicating its robustness in capacity. MMLongBench has fewer documents (135) but is characterized by a lower average token count (21,214), which might suggest a focus on varying complexity across fewer, possibly denser, documents with specific document types indicated (57). Patterns show that while DocBench appears to primarily assess general multimodal understanding, MMLongBench appears tailored for long-context comprehension. The absence of document type information for DocBench may indicate a more homogenous set of document types compared to MMLongBench. The significance of this data lies in its direct relation to the context of hybrid knowledge retrieval mechanisms described, as these datasets serve as benchmarks against which the hybrid retrieval strategies are tested, showcasing the performance across domains. Overall, the table highlights how the experiments measure up against substantial challenges in multimodal understanding essential for the synthesis of complex document information, directly correlating with the surrounding context of hybrid retrieval architecture and the need for effective multimodal question answering.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

Here, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\) denotes the set of graph entities, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\) the set of relationships between these entities, and \\\\( c_{j_{j}} \\\\) represents atomic content chunks across different modalities (like text, images, tables, and equations). The function \\\\( \\\\mathrm{emb}(\\cdot) \\\\) is an embedding function that generates a dense vector corresponding to each component \\\\( s \\\\), facilitating similarity searches in the embedding space. This unification cultivates effective retrieval mechanisms by constructing a robust index that captures the semantically rich relationships within multimodal documents. The significance lies in its capacity to encode inherent knowledge connections and enhance cross-modal retrieval through structural and semantic correlations. By combining these sets, the equation establishes a foundation upon which sophisticated retrieval strategies can operate, ensuring that non-textual modalities like images or equations are readily accessible and analyzable alongside textual data. This construction addresses the potential pitfalls in traditional models by maintaining modality-specific attributes while facilitating robust cross-modal relationships. Thus, this equation plays a crucial role in bridging diverse information types in a comprehensive manner, greatly enhancing the retrieval accuracy and effectiveness in multimodal contexts.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

Here, {\\\\mathcal{P}}(q) refers to the structured textual context created from retrieved multimodal chunks, while {\\\\mathcal{V}}^{\\\\star}(q) encompasses the original visual data necessary for coherent synthesis. The operations include retrieving, processing, and integrating both text and visual modalities, which highlights the function of a VLM as it generates a response that is factually grounded. This process underscores the model's capability to bridge structural knowledge derived from the structured context and semantic knowledge captured in the visual input. In this context, the equation serves as a critical component in the broader discussion of hybrid retrieval mechanisms that enhance multimodal question-answering systems, reflecting the intricate balance between semantic and structural understanding of information across modalities. This equation is connected to the theme of hybrid architecture, demonstrating how a VLM synthesizes multimodal knowledge into coherent responses. Practical applications include advanced AI systems in domains like education, where they need to answer complex questions that require understanding both textual and visual data.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

The first chart, labeled 'DocBench Accuracy,' is a line graph featuring two different data series: 'RAGAnything' in blue and 'MMGraphRAG' in orange. The x-axis represents the page range categories (1-10, 11-50, 51-100, 101-200, and 200+), while the y-axis indicates accuracy in percentage. The blue line generally trends higher than the orange, signifying superior performance of 'RAGAnything.' The second chart, 'DocBench QA Counts,' is a bar chart with the same page range on the x-axis. The y-axis shows 'QA Pair Count' without a label for the unit of measurement. The third chart, labeled 'MMLongBench Accuracy,' mirrors the first chart but with different data values showing accuracy metrics for different benchmarks. The final chart, 'MMLongBench QA Counts,' shows a bar chart similar to the second chart. The charts employ a consistent color scheme for clarity. There are no visual legends or extra elements in the image, making it straightforward to interpret. The overall appearance is clean, with a focus on data presentation.\n```",

The first chart, labeled 'DocBench Accuracy,' is a line graph featuring two different data series: 'RAGAnything' in blue and 'MMGraphRAG' in orange. The x-axis represents the page range categories (1-10, 11-50, 51-100, 101-200, and 200+), while the y-axis indicates accuracy in percentage. The blue line generally trends higher than the orange, signifying superior performance of 'RAGAnything.' The second chart, 'DocBench QA Counts,' is a bar chart with the same page range on the x-axis. The y-axis shows 'QA Pair Count' without a label for the unit of measurement. The third chart, labeled 'MMLongBench Accuracy,' mirrors the first chart but with different data values showing accuracy metrics for different benchmarks. The final chart, 'MMLongBench QA Counts,' shows a bar chart similar to the second chart. The charts employ a consistent color scheme for clarity. There are no visual legends or extra elements in the image, making it straightforward to interpret.

The first row details the method names while the next rows provide performance metrics for academic, financial, governmental, legal, and news domains, alongside text, multimodal, and unannotated types. 'RAG-Anything' outperforms both baseline methods in most categories, particularly in the multimodal domain, indicating its effective graph-based retrieval system. The overall accuracy statistics reveal that 'Chunk-only' achieved the lowest overall score of 60.0%, while 'RAG-Anything' reached a score of 63.4%, demonstrating the importance of dual-graph construction. The data points substantiate claims about RAG-Anything's architectural design, showcasing how preserving structural relationships leads to enhanced performance, particularly in cross-modal integrations as outlined in the surrounding context. This directly illustrates the superiority of RAG-Anything over traditional methods, which struggle with structural comprehension and navigating complex, multimodal documents.\n```",

On the left, there is a visual representation labeled 'Multimodel Document.' This section appears to be a blurred, full-page view of a financial document from which a specific area is highlighted. The highlight is achieved using a semi-transparent blue overlay, directing attention to a particular table section on the right. On the right side, a zoomed-in view of the highlighted section is shown. This is labeled 'Evidence table in the document' and features a financial table titled '2.4 Employee costs.' The central focus of this table is on the 'Wages and salaries' row and its corresponding value for the year 2020, which is prominently boxed in red and reads '26,778.' The table also contains columns for the years 2019 and 2018 with their respective financial values. The overall color scheme is minimalistic, using primarily white, black, and shades of blue to emphasize key areas. The visual directs the viewer's attention through arrows, articulating the process of identifying evidence within a multimodal document. The lighting is neutral with clear, legible text, and the style is consistent with analytical or business documentation.\n```",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

The first row details the method names while the next rows provide performance metrics for academic, financial, governmental, legal, and news domains, alongside text, multimodal, and unannotated types. 'RAG-Anything' outperforms both baseline methods in most categories, particularly in the multimodal domain, indicating its effective graph-based retrieval system. The overall accuracy statistics reveal that 'Chunk-only' achieved the lowest overall score of 60.0%, while 'RAG-Anything' reached a score of 63.4%, demonstrating the importance of dual-graph construction. The data points substantiate claims about RAG-Anything's architectural design, showcasing how preserving structural relationships leads to enhanced performance, particularly in cross-modal integrations as outlined in the surrounding context. This directly illustrates the superiority of RAG-Anything over traditional methods, which struggle with structural comprehension and navigating complex, multimodal documents.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

On the left, there is a visual representation labeled 'Multimodel Document.' This section appears to be a blurred, full-page view of a financial document from which a specific area is highlighted. The highlight is achieved using a semi-transparent blue overlay, directing attention to a particular table section on the right. On the right side, a zoomed-in view of the highlighted section is shown. This is labeled 'Evidence table in the document' and features a financial table titled '2.4 Employee costs.' The central focus of this table is on the 'Wages and salaries' row and its corresponding value for the year 2020, which is prominently boxed in red and reads '26,778.' The table also contains columns for the years 2019 and 2018 with their respective financial values. The overall color scheme is minimalistic, using primarily white, black, and shades of blue to emphasize key areas. The visual directs the viewer's attention through arrows, articulating the process of identifying evidence within a multimodal document. The lighting is neutral with clear, legible text, and the style is consistent with analytical or business documentation.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

    "return": "RAG-Anything is a sophisticated system and proposed framework aimed at addressing the complexities associated with multimodal knowledge representation and retrieval. It employs dual-graph construction strategies, which enhance both the understanding and retrieval of diverse modalities. This unified framework supports the retrieval process across various types of information, making it applicable to a wide range of contexts.\n\nIn addition to its foundational purpose, RAG-Anything also functions as a hybrid retrieval architecture that merges structural knowledge navigation with semantic similarity matching. This combination is particularly effective for document retrieval tasks, enabling enhanced document analysis and navigation. A specific application noted for RAG-Anything is its capability to transform financial report tables into structured graphs, facilitating improved insights from typically complex data formats.\n\nRAG-Anything has demonstrated superior performance in multimodal document understanding, notably achieving top results in the MMLongBench evaluation, which assesses models based on their efficacy across multiple document categories. Its effectiveness in these categories reflects its advanced capabilities over other methods in the multimodal domain, establishing RAG-Anything as a leading model in the field of multimodal knowledge representation and indexing.",

Input Format: The description list is provided in JSON format. Each JSON object (representing a single description) appears on a new line within the `Description List` section.\n2. Output Format: The merged description will be returned as plain text, presented in multiple paragraphs, without any additional formatting or extraneous comments before or after the summary.\n3. Comprehensiveness: The summary must integrate all key information from *every* provided description. Do not omit any important facts or details.\n4. Context: Ensure the summary is written from an objective, third-person perspective; explicitly mention the name of the entity or relation for full clarity and context.\n5. Context & Objectivity:\n  - Write the summary from an objective, third-person perspective.\n  - Explicitly mention the full name of the entity or relation at the beginning of the summary to ensure immediate clarity and context.\n6. Conflict Handling:\n  - In cases of conflicting or inconsistent descriptions, first determine if these conflicts arise from multiple, distinct entities or relationships that share the same name.\n  - If distinct entities/relations are identified, summarize each one *separately* within the overall output.\n  - If conflicts within a single entity/relation (e.g., historical discrepancies) exist, attempt to reconcile them or present both viewpoints with noted uncertainty.\n7. Length Constraint:The summary's total length must not exceed 600 tokens, while still maintaining depth and completeness.\n8. Language: The entire output must be written in English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) may in their original language if proper translation is not available.\n  - The entire output must be written in English.\n  - Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n---Input---\nEntity Name: RAG-Anything\n\nDescription List:\n\n```\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a system designed to address the challenges of multimodal knowledge representation through dual-graph construction strategies.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a proposed framework for multimodal knowledge representation and retrieval that utilizes a dual-graph construction strategy for enhanced understanding and retrieval of diverse modalities.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a unified framework designed to support multimodal knowledge retrieval across diverse types of information.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a unified multimodal framework demonstrating superior performance in multimodal document understanding.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a cross-modal hybrid retrieval architecture that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic similarity matching for document retrieval tasks.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a system designed to transform financial report tables into structured graphs for improved document analysis and navigation.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a proposed universal framework for multimodal knowledge retrieval and indexing.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a framework designed for multimodal document understanding, mentioned as a context for evaluating the experimental datasets.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a leading model in the MMLongBench evaluation, demonstrating superior performance in various document categories.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"RAG-Anything is a method that significantly outperforms other methods in most categories, particularly in the multimodal domain.\"}\n```\n\n---Output---",
